            students to fulfil their aspiring dreams and reach the goals. The
            goals may range from placing in high package companies,
            entrepreneurship, start-ups to higher education, research, societal
            needs and so on. The courses are framed in such a way to bridge the
            gap between Industry and Academics. We strive to empower and
            encourage our students to pave their own path towards success. Our
            former president and scientist Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam stated that the
            growth of India will only depend on proper grooming and nurturing of
            these young masses with the dreams kept high and alive. This is well
            taken care by our extremely dedicated teach force, an absolute live
            wire tying this whole system to be alive and sustained. The faculty
            of the department not only excel in teaching technical nuances but
            also skilled in research, publishing, tapping funding from external
            agencies, patents and more. We do excel at counselling and guidance
            to keep the students vibes up and roaring. Moreover the department
            has strong bonds with industries and have specialized labs including
            Malware Analysis from K7 computing, Network Simulator with NETSIM
            from Tetcos, CISCO Networking, IoT Center of Excellence, Cloud
            Computing and many more. This has influenced our placements in turn
            and almost all our eligible students get placed in reputed companies
            with a very high package. We support the student activities that
            nurture them in organizing and take lead in our Networking and
            Communications Association and various student clubs namely SRM
            OWASP, SRM Team Hackathon, Hack the Box and so on. With this short
            note, I am extremely proud to head such a well formulated task force
            comprising of students, teaching and non-teaching staffs and
            research scholars. There is no doubt that this department would be a
            remarkable place to start your journey. Also you may feel free to

            laurels which will make you awe for sure. If you are interested to
